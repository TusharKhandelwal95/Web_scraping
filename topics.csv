We trialed a unique approach with a custom implementation of the EigenTrust algorithm. Special thanks to Carl Cervone (Open Source Observer), Emily Furlong (Optimism Foundation) and Eugene Kim (OpenRank), Jenya Nepoimannykh (OpenRank). The Foundational Method: Capturing the Web of Trust via Recursive Trust Graph Given a community of peers, their interactions with each other form a directed graph. Here, the peers become nodes within the graph and their interactions are the graph edges. These asymmetric edges can be viewed as trust arcs from one peer to the other. Additionally, the weight of each edge signals the degree of trust imparted by one peer onto another. The EigenTrust algorithm can then be run on such graphs to measure the impact of recursive trust propagation, leading to a global trust value for each peer or node in the network. Thus, every node gets assigned a reputation score. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph. EigenTrust not only works well with peer-to-peer data, but it can also be used for bipartite graphs, the implementation of which is achieved using the Hubs and Authorities algorithm. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph. The Goal of the Exercise and the Choice of Algorithm Goal To rank developers, identified by their GitHub accounts, based on their proximity to OP Stack repos. Approach OpenRank enables verifiable compute for a large class of reputation algorithms, **in particular those that (a) operate on a graph, (b) are iterative in nature and (c) have a tendency toward convergence. In the following sections, we give a brief overview of some of these algorithms. For our Developer ranking use case, we obtained a graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories. We established two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust, the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph. Below are the two different trust edges used in the graph: User-to-repository trust - this signals the user‚Äôs interest in the repository through actions such as stars, forks and issue/PR submissions. Repository-to-user trust - this signals the credit extended by the repository to the user for their contribution. Actions such as PRs merged, direct code commits received, and other maintenance actions. The reason for using these two different and asymmetric trust arcs between users and GitHub repositories is to ensure accuracy and sybil resistance in the rankings. For trust-critical use cases, shared interest signal is often not necessarily a good measure of trust. For example, sybil actors can create thousands of trust arcs directed to a malicious or irrelevant repository. We solve this in two ways, choose a set of somewhat trustworthy/useful seed peers (GitHub repositories); and using a trust arc from a repository to a user based on a relevant credit signal such as merging a PR. Once the compute is run, the resulting global trust can be used for ranking both users and GitHub repositories. Compute Model Assumptions and Weights Trust Signals In this model, we use developers (GitHub username) and OP Stack repositories as nodes in the trust graph. We establish trust arcs between users and repositories and vice versa in the following manner: User-to-repository actions (interest signals) include: Starring the repository Forking the repository Opening an issue Opening a pull request Directly committing to the repository Repository-to-user actions (credit signals) include: Having a pull request merged into the repository (approximated by opening of a pull request as of this exercise) Directly committing to the repository Repository maintenance, such as merging a PR, resolving an issue, etc. Choice of Seed Peers and Alpha Value Seed peers are core OP Stack repo, weighted by their relative importance. Core repos with higher importance (weight =2) ‚Äòtestinprod-op-erigon‚Äô ‚Äòa16z/magi‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/optimism‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/op-geth‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/asterisc‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/kona‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/design-docs‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/specs‚Äô Other core repos with importance (weight=1) ‚Äòethereum-optimism/superchain-ops‚Äô, ‚Äòethereum-optimism/op-analytics‚Äô Alpha (Œ±) Value Œ± is a parameter in EigenTrust algorithm that determines the significance of seed peers influence that shapes the reputation score of every other peers in the entire network. Alpha value is normally chosen between 0 and 0.5 and the higher the alpha the stronger the influence of seed peers, meaning the trust arc from seed peers to other peers will matter more for a peer‚Äôs relative reputation. A weak alpha value ( Œ±=0.2 ) is chosen in this exercise, intending to discover more repos related to OP stack, and attribute contribution back to developers. Relatively less influential seed peers could let the other peers express more reputation credit to other repos and peers, therefore suits the purpose of the exercise. To read more about alpha value, check out the EigenTrust documentation here. Reasoning of the Weights Choices for Trust Arcs The weight ratio in the same class of actions (user-to-repo, or repo-to-user) matters. User-to-repo weights signals the seriousness of interest as well as the effort that would go into the action. Least to most significant: Forking < (committing directly, starring) < (opening issue, merging PR) < opening PR. A relative weight was assigned accordingly. Forking is a chore when someone wants to take a look at the repo and try something out quickly. (weight=1) Starring is a long-term interest signal to get updates from the repo and also skew the feed. (weight=5) Opening an issue actually takes nonnegligible effort. (weight=10) Opening a PR takes more effort as it also has proposed changes. PR opening reflects an original work. (weight =20) PR merging reflects a maintenance/review action. Typically it takes more effort for someone to create a patch and open a PR than to review it. (weight =10) Direct commits would normally sit between opening an issue and opening a PR; there are a lot of automated direct commits/pushes so we dial it down to the same level as opening an issue. (weight=5) Repo-to-user weight signals the degree of credit ‚Äúthank you‚Äù from the repo(‚Äôs maintainers) to contributors (users). It can be thought of credit/‚Äúthank you‚Äù from the repository to the contributors. Least to most significant: merging PR (maintainer action) < direct commits (maintainer/allow-listed contributor action) < authoring and submitting a PR (which was eventually merged). A relative weight was assigned accordingly. Iteration on the Ranking Results There were several rounds of iteration on the algorithm, but it should by no means be interpreted to be in its final state. The process of adjusting and improving an algorithm of this type is a continuing effort and we imagine that this algorithm still has room for improvement, but is of sufficient quality for use in this experiment. The first iteration of the algorithm appeared to overvalue outdated repos, so we added a time decay function. We also adjusted the weight of seed repos to reflect the relative importance to the OP stack. In running the algorithm we discovered that the choice between an alpha value of 0.5 and 0.2 did not have a significant effect on the ranking. Discussion: Future Optimizations and Sybil-resistance This is the first iteration of using OpenRank to compute reputation within OP Stack based on data inputs from Open Source Observer, eg: Github event data. A few topics can be explored further. Additional Signals for Increasing Model Performance and Sybil Resistance Using real (non-approximated) signal of having a pull request merged into the repository Instead of approximating ‚Äúopened PR = merged PR‚Äù Parsing GitHub events for more concrete signs of collaboration (eg, comments on issues, co-authored pull requests) and assessing the quality of those collaboration signals (eg, a conversation taking place over multiple weeks might be higher signal than one over a shorter interval) Both interest signals and credit signals are captured in the same local trust matrix. The local trust may also capture user-user and repo-repo trust signals (the latter being, once again, the success attribution signals), so the graph is not necessarily bipartite. Some examples: Following/Starring other users Repository dependencies (if repo A depends on repo B, A‚Äôs success should be attributed to B) Factoring Action‚Äôs Size into the Trust Arc Weight Example: PR importance (e.g. documentation fix < a whole new feature) Subjective factor (what kind of PR is it? feature? bug fix? doc? does the project use labels for these?) Objective factor (change size?) Expanded Seed Trust Use a wider selection of OP-related repos so users‚Äô contribution to those repos will directly increase the user‚Äôs trust standing via the seed trust Try and include both actors and objects in the seed. Actors-only or objects-only seed trust often yields to slow convergence. Associate different weights to seed repos, e.g. according to their importance About OpenRank OpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any developer. The Verifiability of OpenRank powered Reputation Scores As a reputation protocol, the permissionless verifiability of the scores is a key property of OpenRank‚Äôs proposition. The verification methods that we propose are far cheaper than verification of general purpose computations, based on the intuition that iterative convergent algorithms on a graph are expensive to compute, but inexpensive to check (typically requiring one matrix-vector multiplication to check for convergence). This makes it far more practical to use this reputation computer for these use cases than a general purpose decentralized compute network.

My work focuses substantially on the OP ecosystem. For example, I placed 1st in the audit contest on the Bedrock Upgrade . I‚Äôve also audited Base, Blast, and Fraxtal (all OP stack chains). I am organizing the Fault Proof CTF event this summer, which will serve as the final line of defense for the security of fault proofs before deploying to mainnet. I served on the Developer Advisory Board for Season 5, taking an active role in streamlining DAB processes to ensure the members were well coordinated. In my work with the DAB, I provided private feedback to the Grants Council, as well as providing public feedback on many Mission Requests and applications (ex: 1 , 2 , 3 ). In a past life, I co-founded and ran Scribe Media . This is irrelevant technically, but provided helpful experience in leading a team of 100+ people that will carry over to this role. Board Charter: Link to original Charter: Season 5 Charter The Developer Advisor Board should be greatly expanded in Season 6 to make better use of the technical expertise of the group. Here is the proposed & expanded charter: Support the Optimism community through important technical decisions. Provide plain English explanations of all protocol upgrades for the community. Act as one of four delegate approvals that will be required before a Protocol Upgrade can move to a vote. Be available for consultation by delegates regarding important technical decisions, especially protocol upgrades. Support the Grants Council on evaluation technical Mission Requests. Review Mission Request drafts and provide guidance to the Grants Council, specifically focusing on their technical merits and whether the grant size is reasonable. Review applications for Mission Requests and provide guidance to the applicants as well as the Grants Council, specifically focusing on the team‚Äôs detailed plan and whether they seem to be capable of executing on the mission. Review work product delivered for milestones on existing grants to provide guidance on whether the milestones have been successfully achieved. Use ‚Äúveto power‚Äù to keep Grants Council technically grounded (ie. a unanimous ‚Äúno‚Äù vote by the DAB on any of these topics will block the Grants Council from voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù). Bring an additional technical perspective to thinking about the vision of the OP ecosystem and what needs to happen to get there. Be available for discussions for any core OP devs to provide an outside voice on technical and security related decisions. Support in finding technical talent to fill important roles at OP Labs. Generate ideas for the Builders Ideas list to spur community contributions. Other Logistics: All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual Breakdown of Board Operating Budget: Lead (1) = 25k OP (+5k from last season) The increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities based on the changes outlined in this proposal. Specifically, the Lead will be responsible for: (a) leading all board meetings, (b) interfacing with other areas in OP governance to ensure the DAB is supporting where possible, (c) working with Upgrade Czar on approving protocol upgrades, (d) providing feedback for DAB members on their performance, (e) exercising decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus, and (f) writing & sharing the retrospective after Season 6 on changes to improve the DAB going forward. Upgrade Czar (1) = 17.5k OP (+5k from last season) This role did not exist last season. All Members were paid 12.5k OP, and the increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities.

Specifically, the Ops Lead is responsible for ensuring that all DAB tasks are well orchestrated and happen on time, including: (a) improving the IOPs, (b) scheduling meetings, (c) interfacing with other Councils, (d) organizing spreadsheets for feedback, and (e) looking for any other opportunities to make changes that will keep the DAB‚Äôs efforts focused and effective OP Labs Representative (1) = 0 OP (equal to last season) Additional Members (3) = 10k OP each = 30k OP (-7.5k from last season) All Members were paid 12.5k OP last season, but also shared some of the responsibilities that will be taken on by the other roles this season. I believe 10k OP is sufficient to incentivize top talent to participate, especially given the possibility for RetroPGF. Note: If you‚Äôre paying close attention, you‚Äôll see that the math on the changes doesn‚Äôt exactly add up. This is because, last season, one of the members (Noah) was unpaid. However, this budget includes the ‚Äúworst case‚Äù assumption that all Members are paid, although it is possible that Noah (or someone else) opts to forfeit compensation.

15,"Inflation Adjustment Proposal Template",https://gov.optimism.io/t/inflation-adjustment-proposal-template/5923,"system April 25, 2023, 9:45pm 1 Background Inflation of the OP token is set to a default % each year. This inflation takes place via the MintManager contract calling the mint() function on the OP token contract at 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042 . This inflation parameter can be adjusted by Optimism Collective Governance. While the Citizens‚Äô House is still in early stages, inflation adjustment will be determined via vote from the Token House, as specified in the Operating Manual . Note that this may not be the final governance process for inflation; the system may evolve as additional governance rights and capabilities come online. Inflation accrues to the ‚ÄúUnallocated‚Äù portion of the OP token allocations. The Unallocated portion of the token supply is held in reserve for future programs. For now, the Collective is focused on building healthy processes around the existing active portions of the token supply. How the Inflation Adjustment Vote works In the Voting Cycle that ends closest to and before May 31st, the Token House may vote to set inflation to any value between 0% and 2%, inclusive. If no proposal passes, inflation will remain at the rate last approved by governance. In 2024, an Inflation Adjustment Vote may take place in Special Voting Cycle #23a , which runs from May 23 - May 29, 2024. If more than one Inflation Adjustment Proposal is passed by governance, the proposal with the highest ratio of yes votes to total votes cast will pass. Inflation Adjustment should follow the template provided below and will need 4 top 100 delegate approvals by May 22nd at 19:00 GMT to proceed to a vote in Special Voting Cycle #23a , as outlined in the Operating Manual . Inflation Adjustment Proposal Template Inflation Adjustment Proposals should follow the template below: Summary What is this inflation adjustment proposal? Motivation Why should the Collective adjust inflation? Specification This proposal would set an inflation rate for [ YEAR ] of [ X% ]. If approved, and if not superceeded by another Inflation Adjustment Proposal with higher approval, this proposal will result in a one-time mint of OP of [ X ]% of the current total supply (4,294,967,296 OP) equal to [Y] tokens. This inflation will occur on or shortly after May 31 and accrues to the ‚Äúunallocated‚Äù portion of the token supply. If not approved, and unless another Inflation Adjustment Proposal is approved, inflation will remain at the rate last approved by governance, which was 0%. Inflation will occur on or shortly after May 31 and accrues to the ‚Äúunallocated‚Äù portion of the token supply.

Considering that Optimism‚Äôs revenues are tied to sequencer revenues, exploring alternative ways to generate income (contributing to the sustainability of the collective and its programs) is highly strategic. Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For Optimism The value proposition of the Superchain may be correct, but we, along with other delegates, continue to maintain the thesis that sequencer fees are going to 0. While there is no ‚Äòimmediate urgency‚Äô to achieve this, I believe it would be beneficial to start a deeper conversation on this topic to tap into the collective intelligence. To give structure to the process, I propose using the first two steps suggested by the ‚Äòcollective proposal creation‚Äô described in the sociocratic model . I like this framework because it emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem and defining ‚Äòthe rules of the game‚Äô before jumping into suggesting solutions in a creative brainstorming process. Collective Proposal Creation: Step 1 ‚Äì Understanding the Issue : First, a moment where we focus on grasping the context before diving into solutions. The intention is to create a list of ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô that the proposal should include or take into consideration to address the underlying needs and ensure it is sustainable over time. Step 2 ‚Äì Explore Ideas : A moment to aspire to collective creativity, widening the scope of ideas. Step 2a ‚Äì Picture forming (dimensions) : It is confirmed that there is shared understanding and acceptance of the ‚Äòlist of dimensions‚Äô to consider, ensuring that all elements are compatible with each other. Step 2b ‚Äì Gathering proposal ideas : A brainstorming session is invited, which can occur synchronously or asynchronously. Here, ideas may oppose each other. The goal is quantity over quality. Ideally, we all chip in with ideas. Step 2c ‚Äì Synthesize : A smaller group of participants (whether representatives of stakeholders or leaders in the process) are invited to create a ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù that integrates the best of all ideas in a way that addresses the entire (or a good portion of the) list of dimensions. The result of this synthesis could be seen as a valuable input for the OP Foundation to create a proposal based on it, as suggested in the current phase of ‚Äò The Path to Open Metagovernance ‚Äô. List of dimensions: Therefore, the first step would be to agree (both the Foundation and Labs, as well as other relevant voices from the collective) on the list of questions/dimensions that any successful proposal (for a revenue model) must address. In other words, what elements it should include and what limitations exist. Some examples of things to consider. The proposed model should: Be executable even if the sequencer fees go to 0. Respect the Working Constitution and the guiding principles of the Law of Chains . Be compatible with the protection of user rights and the security of funds from a technical perspective. Operate under a four-pillar design philosophy of simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and optimism. Contribute to scale Ethereum technology and values & build an internet that benefits all, and is owned by all. Do you have any additional considerations that I haven‚Äôt mentioned? What is the frame of reference that we cannot forget? What prior agreements should not be modified? cc. @GFXlabs @Gonna.eth @MattL @AnthiasLabs @ccerv1 @SEEDGov @LuukDAO @system In conclusion, I hope you see this as an invitation to delve deeper into this conversation in a structured manner, with the confidence that we can continue to innovate in how we add value to the ecosystem sustainably over time.

As outlined in the Collective‚Äôs Working Constitution , the Foundation‚Äôs role is to bootstrap the governance system of the Collective over multiple years, gradually bringing more governance rights online until the system can manage itself. Metagovernance refers to the ability to propose changes to the design of the governance system. Given the importance of this responsibility, metagovernance is the last governance responsibility that will be transferred to the community. The CFC serves as an experimental training ground to develop a ‚ÄúCore Governance Program‚Äù that will allow the Collective to take on metagovernance responsibilities in the future. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. The goal of the CFC is to enable the Foundation to become just one of many Core Governors proposing metagovernance proposals in the future (similar to how OP Labs is just one of many Core Developers proposing protocol upgrades.) This will require a multi-year, gradual, and iterative process. The CFC began with an initial six month pilot in which members were primarily ‚Äúconsulting the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.‚Äù You can see the full pilot retrospective here . Based on the impact of the pilot, the Foundation has decided to continue iterating with the CFC. Iterations of the Commission will gradually increase the set of member responsibilities over time as well as increase the number of members the Commission can support. The next iteration of the Commission will launch on November 4th. Qualifying participants will be notified by October 28th and will be required to opt-in and KYC by November 1st. Please note that while we will continue the Commission, we will be postponing the launch of the open contribution path component until we have further refined the best format to accomplish the longer term goals of the Commission. It is one full workstream to design how the Commission works and another workstream to create the contribution path that supports it. We are still committed to supporting this path in the future, but need to focus our efforts on the refinement and development of the core workstream first. We will continue to invest in the many opportunities outside the Commission for the broader community to provide feedback to the Foundation. image 2484√ó606 33.1 KB Season 7 Collective Feedback Commission Charter Season 7 CFC Goals The next iteration of the CFC will begin on November 4th and run through the end of Season 7. Goals: Allow members to gain more insight into the Foundation‚Äôs approach to governance design, building shared context around the how and why Create a more collaborative working process between the Foundation and the Commission, involving Commission members in the earlier stages of our design process: planning and research Allow for member specialization based on level and type of expertise, accomplished via the distinct tracks outlined below Allow members to have more agency over lower stakes design parameters Non-goals: The pilot made it obvious that we need to further refine the Foundation‚Äôs working relationship with the CFC before we can ask members to develop the lower levels of the contribution path and mentor new participants. We are still committed to the development of this contribution path in the future and would recommend joining the govNERDS contribution path to build up relevant knowledge and skills in the meantime (join the wannabe-govnerds channel in Discord for more info!) As always, after each version, there will be a participant survey and retrospective workshop to inform the next iteration. You can find the pilot retrospective here . Season 7 CFC Structure image 2136√ó1256 123 KB Participants The Collective Feedback Commission will be split into three different tracks to allow for different levels of engagement and to accommodate different types of expertise.

Simona Pop, a Foundation Advisor, will serve as the Commission Lead. Foundation Leads will facilitate context sharing between the Commission and the Foundation. The Commission Lead will manage Commission operations and hold the Foundation accountable to executing on this Charter. * There will be 18 eligible members. Qualification of members will based on demonstrable contributions/attestations relevant to each area of required expertise. All members must opt-in to participate. The full list will be added as a comment to this post on October 25th. The CFC is an experiment and membership models are subject to change with each iteration. We will continue to invest in the many opportunities outside the Commission for the broader community to provide feedback to the Foundation. Note: Pilot membership was determined via delegation rankings in the Token House and via demonstrable contributions in the Citizens‚Äô House. This led to a high degree of overlap between members of the CFC and other leadership roles in the Collective. The current iteration experiments with selection based on expertise. We are likely to continue experimenting with different selection methods in future iterations. Season 7 Responsibilities Individual members of the Collective Feedback Commission will: Provide feedback on early Foundation design drafts, roadmaps, frameworks, etc. Participate in broader design discussions with the Foundation via monthly meetings Provide feedback on community authored Mission Requests to ensure they align with Season 7 Intents and/or other strategic initiatives Execute on contributions as scoped by the Foundation (members of the Design Research track will do this via Project Partnerships) Note: The Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or implement the recommendations in any contribution. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, and may be made publicly viewable by the entire community at the end of the Commission‚Äôs term. The Foundation will provide summaries of the impact of all contributions. Foundation Track Leads will: To the best of our ability, request feedback on regular feedback cycles. Project Partnerships will be scoped with clear deliverables and deadlines. Host monthly calls with the Foundation governance design team to share context and facilitate a two-way dialogue with Commission members. Propose a selection mechanism that determines which members claim specific pieces of work, subject to simple majority approval by members at the start of the term. The Commission Lead will: Onboard new Commission members, ensuring they are familiar with the CFC‚Äôs processes, mission, and operational structure. This includes providing any necessary documentation or training to help them contribute effectively from the start. Propose the evaluation algorithm by which rewards will be distributed to individual members at the start of the term, subject to majority (51%) approval (see ‚ÄúRewards‚Äù section below). Ensure members of each track are executing on their responsibilities in a timely manner and flag any blockers to execution to the Foundation. Facilitate feedback loops and coordination between Commission members and the Foundation, when needed, holding the Foundation accountable to this Charter. Organize regular Commission meetings, as desired by members. The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization. Authoring, or coordinating authorship, of any regular communication reports circulated to the broader community. Conduct feedback survey, facilitate peer reviews, and host retrospective workshop at the end of the Commission‚Äôs term to inform the next iteration Note: Leads are operational roles, meaning they do not engage in the day-to-day activities of the team but rather manage the operations of the team. This means Leads don‚Äôt review, vote, or sign but they may exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker). Leads may also draft any applications for impact evaluation of the Commission, although we don‚Äôt expect Retro Funding to be applicable to the Commission‚Äôs work in Season 7 (see below.) Season 7 Rewards The CFC will be allocated 100,000 OP by the Foundation. The Commission Lead will be compensated separately, via an agreement with the Foundation. These tokens will come out of the Unallocated Portion of the treasury, managed by the Foundation, since the CFC provides a valuable service to the Foundation. We are providing these rewards as we believe the work of the Commission is difficult to evaluate retroactively and therefore the CFC‚Äôs work should not depend on being eligible for Retro Funding. Retro Funding is best suited to evaluating measurable and permissionless impact, whereas the Commission‚Äôs work is hard to measure and is currently permissioned to members selected by the Foundation. The level of impact generated by the Commission might also be higher or lower in a given season due to factors outside the Commission‚Äôs control, such as the Foundation‚Äôs experiment design. Members will vote via simple majority to approve an evaluation algorithm, proposed by the Lead at the start of the term, via which rewards will be allocated from this budget at the end of the season. The Lead will calculate individual rewards based on the approved evaluation algorithm at the end of the Season and rewards should be allocated accordingly. The Foundation recommends a minimum 48 hour dispute window to allow members to verify the correct application of the evaluation algorithm before contacting the Foundation to deliver rewards.

25,"Grant Misuse Reporting Process",https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346,"system January 11, 2024, 6:43pm 1 Index Optimism Grant Misuse Reporting Process What is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process? Definitions Scope of Process Report Criteria Grant Misuse Report Process Process Overview Considerations When Making a Report Protection for Involved Parties Report Validation Grant Misuse Report Template Optimism Grant Misuse Reporting Process In decentralised ecosystems it can be hard to stay on top of Grant usage and milestone execution. It is important that grant recipients are accountable to the Collective in order for Optimism to maintain a sustainable & healthy governance system. As the Optimism ecosystem expands there will be (and has been) a growing need to be able to find, track and call out these Grant Misuses. This process is intended to help the reporting community members (‚ÄùReporters‚Äù) to come forward with objective evidence based reports of Grant misuses in a safe and objective way. This is the first iteration of this process, and the process will evolve with each season (much like everything else) to support the Optimism Collective‚Äôs needs. What is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process? Reporters reveal information about or bring attention to potential misuse of Collective Grants. These Reports ARE anonymous. Reporters need to use accounts that are not associated with their real identity (Reporters are responsible for maintaining their own anonymity). Reports and evidence provided should be trustless. The Reporter should be inconsequential to the report as the evidence provided should be undeniable. In line with this, only onchain actions can be reported through this process (see Validation Requirements). If you are looking to report someone for non Grant related offchain behaviour, please see the Rules of Engagement . Where a Report is determined to be valid and enforceable, the penalty will be for both the Project (team or dapp) and the founding members listed in the Grant to be recorded in the public ‚Äú Misuse Reports Database ‚Äù labeled under the severity of Misuse (see Definitions). This will allow Delegates, Badgeholders & Citizens to make informed decisions on future grants. Definitions For the purpose of this process we use the following definitions: Team : The group, individual or project team that received the Grant. Commitment : The agreement or formal representations and public commitments the Team used to receive granted tokens or be allocated tokens (see Scope of Process ). Misuse : In this process, the term ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù is defined in levels of severity, starting from least severe to the most. Misuse must be in relation to a Commitment. Only Grants made from March 2023 onward can be reported in this system. Failure to meet Critical Milestones : The Grants Council is responsible for checking critical Milestone completions. As such, failure to meet Milestones is NOT in scope of misuse. The sole exception to this are Season 4 Missions (which are out of scope for the Grants Council ), which may be reported for ‚ÄúMissing Milestone(s)‚Äù. Breaking Commitments : Using tokens differently from Commitments is against the grant policies. Minor violations: Where meaningful, good faith steps have been taken to execute on the Commitments consistent with their spirit, but Commitments are still breached, the Grantee has committed a ‚Äúminor violation‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., a mild deviation on the specified execution plan. An example of this could look like changing execution plans (in line with the spirt of Commitments) but without approval from the Collective or the applicable Committee. A specific example could be changing the mechanism for sending tokens out in a user incentive campaign (like changing the number of users in a program, or the criteria for a competition, in a way that is still in line with the goal of the associated Commitments). Severe violations: The scope of severe Commitment violations should be limited to the following: Taking no action towards using tokens as defined in the associated Commitments (according to the timeline specified in the Commitment, or after 6 months). Using tokens for actions well outside of the scope of the associated Commitments. Actions that constitute ‚Äúwell outside the scope‚Äù are actions that were not defined in the Commitments, or are substantial and impactful deviations from the specified execution plan in the Commitments. A specific example could be changing the target, so if the grant was originally targeting end users but is now being used for a partnership, or was originally for development of a feature or integration but the grant is now being used for user incentives. Using bots or other manipulative means to fulfil Milestones, or otherwise inflate metrics or mislead the Collective in terms of the Teams progress towards execution. No Sale Violation : Violation of the no sale policy , from the date of implementation (March 2023) forward. Please see the ‚Äú No Sale Policy ‚Äù in the Grant Policies for specifics. Scamming or Rugs : There are a few definitions of scamming: Note that scams or rugs MUST have received or applied for a Grant from The Optimism Collective to be covered under this process. See ‚ÄúReport Criteria‚Äù for more info. Scamming users, or using tokens to scam users. Scamming meaning taking user or Collective assets without providing advertised services, or taking more assets than agreed on (also called ‚Äúdraining‚Äù a wallet). Applying for a Grant/Mission with a fake project or team, impersonating a team and other activity taken to intentionally mislead the Collective or community (e.g: serial scammers). Scope of Process This Reporting Process only covers grants made, and corresponding tokens allocated, by the Optimism Token House. For example, RetroPGF recipients are currently outside the scope of this process (in their capacity as such). The scope may expand to include other programs in the future. Report Criteria The following criteria set aims to ensure reports are relevant to the ecosystem, while balancing potential process abuse or spam. The project, individual, or accused action MUST have taken place on the Optimism network AND with tokens granted by the Optimism Token House. While scams and other abuses, wherever they may take place, are regrettable, this Reporting Process is not designed to capture everything all at once. The Grant Misuse amount in question MUST be equal to or more than 50k OP or $50k USD if not denominated in OP. This minimum is for the amount that has been misused, not the total grant amount. Handling Reports is a time consuming process and should be taken seriously, given it may involve accusations that go to the reputation and credibility of a grant recipient. The activity MUST have taken place onchain, AND be provable onchain. Reports need to meet a high level of objective proof. Sadly, off chain activities are incredibly difficult to prove in a trustless manner, and introduce significant amounts of subjectivity. Note that additional offchain evidence (such as messages) can be used to supplement a claim, but the main evidence for a claim MUST be onchain. Information provided MUST be publicly verifiable. If you do submit screenshots of messages, one should be able to verify it. For example, a screen shot of a Discord server messages are verifiable, DM messages are not. The action MUST have taken place in the last 12 months. Reports should be lively. Reports on Grant Misuse activities that took place far in the past can create uncertainty and duplication, while bogging down the Report evaluation system. The action MUST not already have an active or already reviewed Report. If there is an existing Report please add your evidence to that report. New reports on existing topics will get rejected. If the matter being Reported has already been reported and resolved (regardless of the outcome), the matter will be considered ‚Äúclosed‚Äù for the purposes of this process, and cannot be reopened by a new Report. Grant Misuse Report Process Note: Keep in mind that this Reporting process does not protect you against any legal commitments (such as confidentiality) or obligations (not to defame) that you may have in the context of the information you choose to submit in your Reports. Process Overview The Report is posted in the Governance Form under ‚ÄúGrant Misuse Reports‚Äù. The Report will be unlisted (private) for a maximum of 3 days while it is checked. During this Hold Period (the first 3 days after the report is submitted) the report is checked and the accused is attempted to be notified. Report Checking: The report MUST conform to the template provided in this document. Reports that do not follow the template will be rejected irrespective of report validity. Reports can be resubmitted to conform with the template. Accused notification: During the Hold Period the accused will be sent the report and given opportunity to respond on the forum. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc, whatever communication line was provided in the original Grant) by an official Optimism account. Report posted publicly. After the Hold Period the report is filed publicly in the governance forum under the ‚ÄúGrant Misuse Reports‚Äù section. The Report is validated publicly over a maximum of 6 weeks (see Report Validation for details). During the Validation phase the Reporter may be asked to provide further detail or clarify points. This MUST all happen publicly. Attempts to DM the Reporter will be considered as acting with hostility. In turn, the Reporter may NOT DM the accused, as this will also be seen as acting with hostility. Hostility towards or attacks against a good faith Reporter will be considered a Severe Violation of the Rules of Engagement and may result in the infringer‚Äôs removal from Optimism platforms. See the Rules of Engagement for more info. Outcome of a report. If the report is validated, the Team (group, individual or project team that received the grant) are added to the ‚Äú Misuse Reports Database ‚Äù. If the report fails validation the report is noted as invalid, but no further action is taken against the team or Reporter and nothing is added to the database. Considerations When Making a Report The process for submitting a Report is relatively straightforward. Create a doc with the template provided later in this document. Ensure every claim has a transaction or supplementary evidence, and that your report follows the Report Criteria, and meets the specified Misuse Definition. Make sure your report is clear and as simple to follow as possible. All reports posted in the reporting section will be hidden by default. You are responsible for maintaining your own anonymity, so ensure you are on the correct account BEFORE posting. If your post does not comply with the guidelines or template it will be removed during the Hold Period, and you will be notified. You are free to update the report in line with the feedback you receive and resubmit. Report MUST be factual. Do not editorialize with opinions, subjective statements, or derogatory adjectives. Reports that contain inflammatory language or unsubstantiated claims do not meet the guidelines and will be removed. Accusations and discussions around the report should ONLY happen on the post on the governance forum. Discussions in other platforms (such as Discord) can be seen as harassment or intimidation and may constitute a violation of the Rules of Engagement . Protection for Involved Parties Reporters Reporters should be available to answer questions during the verification phase. Reporters are only expected to respond to public requests for information, and are encouraged to report harassment (both public and private) immediately. Any harassment of a good faith reporter will be treated as a Severe Violation of the Rules of Engagement and may result in the harassers‚Äô removal from all Optimism platforms. Should the accused reach out to the Reporter directly, the accused will immediately be in violation of the Rules of Engagement (see Intimidation) and will result in their suspension from all Optimism platforms. This will happen regardless of if the accused has responded to the report yet. Accused The accused party or project will be notified of the Report before it goes public. The accused will have the Hold Period to pull together a response, or counter evidence. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc) by an official Optimism account. Note that the accused may not attack or even address the reporter, and are ONLY allowed to respond to the evidence provided. Accused may ONLY refer the the reporter as ‚Äúthe Reporter‚Äù. The accused will be notified once the Hold Period is completed, so that they may have the opportunity to be the first response to the Report. Note that the response can only respond to the evidence or narrative provided in the Report. If a response attacks or addresses the reporter (see reporter protections) the response will be removed, and the accused may be suspended from all Optimism platforms. NumbaNERDs Any attempts to DM the NumbaNERDs from either the Reporter or Accused (or associated team) will be considered harassment. All communication MUST happen through the public post and address evidence directly. Report Validation Reports are validated by the NumbaNERDs (a collective of contributors focused on analytics). To disprove or invalidate provided transaction evidence one must prove: The claim misrepresents what happens in the transaction or the transaction had been approved by governance. I.e: if funds are withdrawn from an address but this was a governance approved withdrawal and not a rug. That the provided transaction(s) are not related to the claim or are described in a way that mislead readers as to the nature of the transaction. I.e: the transaction provided is an NFT transfer not a funds transfer. The amount in question is found to be below the required minimum. I.e: The report misrepresented the total amount in question. The Report does not meet any of the standards laid out in the Report Criteria. Anyone can post evidence to prove or disprove elements of a report, however only NumbaNERDs can ultimately Validate or Invalidate a claim. Supporting evidence can be disproven, however this will not get a report invalidated. Validation requirements A GovNERD will ensure the report follows the template, does not contain inflammatory language, and is not a duplicate report. If the Report is invalid, the reporter will be notified. If the Report is valid, an Optimism admin will notify the accused from an official account. Is the claim labeled correctly? i.e if it is ‚ÄúScams & Rugs‚Äù does it fit the definition? At least 3 NumbaNERDs will independently verify the onchain transactions & evidence to ensure it supports the claims being made. Is the amount in question reaching the required minimums? (see report Criteria) Does the evidence support the claim? Is there enough onchain data to back up the claim? If the claim is Valid the govNERDs will play the administrative role of adding the Report to the Database. If the claim is invalid, no action is taken. Verification of a report cannot take longer than 6 weeks in order to limit the process to a reasonable amount of time. If at the end of the 6 weeks a report is not Validated OR Invalidated, it is archived as ‚ÄúUndecided‚Äù and will not be added to the database. Whether a report is Valid, Invalid or Undecided, a new report CANNOT be made for the same misuse. If new evidence is discovered, it can be submitted to the existing report. This will reopen (or extend) the review period by 3 weeks in which the new evidence can be reviewed. If the report is found Invalid or Undecided after this 3 week period the matter is considered settled and cannot be reopened. Reports in the database will not be removed as there is no direct consequence of being listed in the database (it does not result in an automatic future grant freeze, for example). Rather this database alerts governance participants to consider the reports when making future grant decisions. Grant Misuse Report Template Grant Misuse Report Template Before filling out a Report please make sure you have read and understand the ‚ÄúReport Criteria‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúProtections for Involved Parties‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefinitions‚Äù. Reports submitted that fail to meet the required criteria will be removed. Accusation: What Misuse the Accused is being accused of. I.e: Misuse : Violating the No Sale rule on tokens received from the Projects Grant proposal (link to proposal). Total Amounts: For ease of verification, the total amount of tokens or funds in question. I.e: Total token/funds involved : 100,000.00 OP from Token House Grant (linked to grant application). Total grant amount misused : 75,000.00 OP Sold for USDC (TX 20 JAN 2023). OR Total token/funds involved : $ 65,000.00 USDC of stolen user funds Total token/funds misused : $ 65,000.00 USDC user funds stolen (funds were stolen in a complex batch of transactions listed below). Breakdown of misused token/funds : $2,000.00 taken from liquidity pool through admin withdrawal: TX on 20 JAN 2023 etc‚Ä¶ Note that the use of the $ is prohibited in connection with ‚ÄúOP.‚Äù See Important Term documentation for more information. Summary: A summary of the activity. This should be a concise description of WHAT the involved parties are accused of as well as the main evidence of the claim. Try keeping this under 1000 words. I.e: The project ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù received a Grant from the Token House (TX on the 20 OCT 2023) with the following objectives: ‚ÄúIncrease usage on ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù through a user generated content competition‚Äù. However, ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù misused their grant by violating the ‚ÄúNo Sale rule‚Äù. After ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù received their tokens they transfered them to Coinbase over 3 transactions (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023). Each time the address received USDC (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023). When community members asked about these transactions, the team attacked them personally (see supplementary evidence 5). Summaries should be: Clear, easy to follow and contain all the essential information, such as: What the accused had agreed to do in their Commitment. What the specific misuse was. The main evidence of the misuse claim (with transactions, times & dates provided in UTC). Please write out months as 3 letters: DD MMM YYYY. Do NOT use DD.MM.YY or MM.DD.YY formats to avoid confusion. Not contain any personal attacks against the accused, nor make any unsubstantiated claims about the projects or its team. Involved Parties : The offending address(es). Link between project and address(es) should ALWAYS start with the address provided in the Commitment or other provided addresses in the Commitment. Links between individuals and addresses MUST be undeniable (i.e an ENS name as their handle, using the address to apply for Grants in an ecosystem, etc). If you do not have ONLY onchain evidence of a link between an individual and the address(es) then refrain from making this link . Please exercise extreme caution when linking identities to address, as you are still bound by the DOXXing definitions and consequences in the Rules of Engagement . Reports that DOX anyone will be censored (to remove identifying information). If unsure if the information is DOXXing, use the handles/identities used in the gov forum, or simply refer to addresses. I.e: 0x123‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Address provided by ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù in their Grant application. 0x321‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Address that received the USDC. Address is suspected to be @fred42 as the ENS name is fred42.eth, which is also associated with a twitter account by the same name. This is also their handle in the Optimism Governance forum used to post their Commitment. Timeline of events : What happened? This should be the bulk of your report. This should have a step by step timeline of what happened, and link directly to transactions. Try keeping each line item down to a single action. Multiple actions in a step may make the report difficult to follow. Format: Time: Description: Transaction: (optional) Supplemental Evidence: I.e: 02:34 20 MAY 2023 UTC Address 0x123‚Ä¶ initiated a withdraw on project ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù for $1 of their pools liquidity. This is testing the admin withdraw function. Transaction link. 02:36 20 MAY 2023 UTC Address 0x123‚Ä¶ initiated a withdrawal for $65,000.00 of user provided pool liquidity. Transaction link. 02:38 20 MAY 2023 UTC The funds are moved into a Coinbase CEX account. The address is then shortly funded with USDC. Transaction to CEX. Transaction sending USDC. Supplemental Evidence : Evidence that is 1) publicly accessible, and 2) supports your timeline of events. For example, a Tweet from a community member asking about funds moving. This could also be links to previous cases of fraud by mentioned individuals. Only if absolutely necessary should DMs or non-public information be provided. All supplementary evidence must contain a link and a screenshot. SE 1: I.e: SE 1: Tweet from community member asking where the funds have gone. Link to tweet.

The Synapse Protocol is comprised of a messaging framework and an economically secure method to reach consensus on the validity of cross-chain transactions which developers can leverage to build truly native cross-chain applications. The Synapse Bridge is the first user-facing product built on top of the protocol. Our bridge allows users to easily send a variety of assets across 16 EVM and non-EVM blockchains. In a short span of time, our bridge has become one of the most widely used and trusted bridges, processed over $10 billion in total volume, servicing hundreds of thousands of users as well as mass scale dapps like DeFi Kingdoms. Synapse launched support for bridging into and out of Optimism 6 months ago and we‚Äôre thrilled about the opportunity to continue supporting the ecosystem in its new phase. How will tokens be distributed? The Synapse Ecosystem has a few core constituents: Developers Liquidity Providers Users Token Holders Synapse‚Äôs proposed $OP distribution will benefit all of them. Developers Amount: 150,000 $OP As an extensible cross-chain communications network, fostering an ecosystem of developers who create cross-chain enabled applications is our top priority. Since Synapse connects Optimism with 15 different unique blockchain ecosystems, more applications/projects built on top of Synapse translates into more potential user pathways into Optimism. While we continue to build new open source developer tooling and release new documentation, we will also be launching a Grants program to encourage more community members to help build and grow the Synapse Protocol. As part of this grants program, we would use a portion of our $OP to fund any community tools or applications that help users on other chains connect with Optimism and more generally help existing Optimism projects better tap into cross-chain liquidity. Liquidity Providers & Users Amount: 450,000 $OP We currently support two stableswap pools for bridging into and out of Optimism: Stablecoins ETH Collectively, both pools have faciilitated nearly $120 million in volume. Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1.00.50 PM 984√ó118 8.67 KB We currently incentivize each pool with close to 12k SYN (around $36k) per week, or roughly 624,000 SYN (around $2m) per year and have close to $30m of TVL across both pools. Given our stablecoin pool was launched more recently, it only represents 20% of our Optimism TVL. We plan to use a portion of the $OP to incentivize our existing stablecoin pool on Optimism to create a much deeper pool for users to trade / bridge into. Along with the new OP incentives, we will add USDT and DAI to the pool which currently supports USDC and nUSD liquidity. Combined with the SYN emissions we are already contributing, we believe this will be one of the more attractive stablecoin pools in the market and will bring many more users into the Optimism ecosystem. Similarly, since the Optimism ecosystem is still nascent, we think this will become the deepest stableswap pool on Optimism, allowing users to seamlessly move in and out of different stablecoins. The more liquidity supplied in each pool, the cheaper it becomes for users to bridge between chains due to a reduction in slippage. This is important as we have noticed from experience on other chains that quite a lot of users have a preference to use stablecoins as a medium for bridging, rather than ETH. As the Optimism ecosystem grows, users will need a seamless solution to enter it, and we intend to Synapse to be that tool. Token Holders Amount: 400,000 $OP Historically, most SYN liquidity has lived on a number of Ethereum based pools, namely SYN/ETH, SYN/FRAX, and SYN/FEI. This has priced out a lot of prospective holders given the gas fees. In an effort to make it more affordable for users to acquire and trade SYN, we propose creating a new SYN/Stablecoin pool on Curve‚Äôs Optimism instance. As the Synapse network continues to decentralize, it will be imperative for there to be affordable venues to acquire SYN and participate in the cross-chain message validation process. We would direct a portion of the $OP towards incentivizing this pool to ensure proper liquidity. As soon as liquidity is sufficient, we expect a strong influx of users onto Optimism. SYN tokens are currently being emitted on over 10 chains and lots of liquidity providers, especially small to medium sized ones, do not necessarily want to pay ETH gas fees to trade their rewards. Bridging SYN to Optimism to trade it will become natural for those liquidity providers, therefore leading to a large influx of new wallets on Optimism. Additionally, that pool will constantly be arbed vs. other SYN pools (including SYN/ETH where the price depends of ETH) leading to an additional pick-up in activity. How will the distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? More Builders More tools and applications built leveraging Synapse means more avenues for users to enter the Optimism ecosystem. Stablecoin Liquidity Additional liquidity incentives for our Optimism stableswap pool will increase Optimism TVL, in turn making Optimism one of the most efficient venues to trade stablecoins through. The more TVL that enters the ecosystem, the better it is for users, and the more potential users that Optimism can lock into their ecosystem. More Optimism Users With the SYN/Stablecoin Curve pool on Optimism, we expect more users will enter the ecosystem in order to 1) more affordably trade SYN and 2) bridge their SYN and stablecoins into optimism. Both equate to more Optimism users and TVL. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? All of the projects that are funded by our grants program will persist long after the $OP has been used. Many of the developers that are onboarded through the grants program will be exposed to building on Optimism, and may end up dedicating more time to building future projects in the ecosystem Our TVL has been much stickier relative to other networks. We expect liquidity providers, users, and traders of our Optimism pools to be quite sticky. The SYN/Stablecoin pool we‚Äôre proposing will very likely be the most affordable avenue for users to trade SYN far after the incentives are done as all of the main liquidity sources still lives on Ethereum. For reference, there was a SYN/AVAX pool created last year on Trader Joe. While this pool is no longer incentivized, it still has around $500k of TVL and a daily turnover which is sometimes higher than its own liquidity. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed We expect for these incentives to be distributed over the course of the next 6 months How much will your project match in co-incentives Synapse is planning on emitting at least 312,000 SYN tokens (around $1m) to liquidity providers on Optimism in the next 6 months 8 Likes Voting Cycle #1: Roundup OP grants through Season 2: where has the OP gone?

The incentives will be distributed over 6 months and Synapse will match them with 312,000 SYN tokens."
